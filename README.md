# swaycycle

Cycle through all visible windows on a sway[fx] workspace

## Installation

Checkout the repo and execute `make`. You'll need the go toolkit. Then
copy the binary `swaycycle` to some location within your `$PATH`.

## Configuration

Add such a line to your sway config file (e.g. in `$HOME/.config/sway/config`):

```default
bindsym $mod+Tab exec ~/bin/swaycycle
```

## Getting help

Although I'm happy to hear from swaycycle users in private email, that's the
best way for me to forget to do something.
